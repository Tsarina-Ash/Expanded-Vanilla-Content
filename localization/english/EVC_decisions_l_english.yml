  france_economy_decision:0 "Root Out Inefficient Bureaucrats"
  france_economy_decision_desc:0 "Our economy has grown at a unprecedented speed and our government has not been able to keep up with the demand for a larger government. Due to this there has been a huge amount of tax waste and a lower throughput compared to other industrialized nations. Rooting out inefficient bureaucrats and replacing them should do the trick now that there is a greater knowledge of this modern economy."
